# Oldagram
It is a mini instagram clone. 
It is created with the help of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
The contents in the page are rendered out using JS. 
The post-like feature will be added soon. But,the like animation on the post needs some work. Soon it'll be added too.
I used semantic HTML to make the browser more accessible. The following image is a sample of what I built.
